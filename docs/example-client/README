Example App for the QML notifications API. This is an example application
showing how to use push notifications in Ubuntu Touch devices.

= Running on Ubuntu Touch =

Since push is currently only meant for Ubuntu Touch devices, this is meant
to be used in the emulator or on a real device.

* Open the example project in Ubuntu-SDK
* Build a click file
* Run in the emulator or device

= Running on the desktop =

This is more complicated but may be convenient while experimenting:

* Install qtdeclarative5-ubuntu-push-notifications-plugin
* Install ubuntu-push-client
* Run ubuntu-push-client in trivial helper mode:

	UBUNTU_PUSH_USE_TRIVIAL_HELPER=1 ./ubuntu-push-client

* Build click package
* Install in your desktop:

	sudo click install --all-users com.ubuntu.developer.push.ubuntu-push-example_0.1_all.click

* Run example app from the SDK using the "Desktop" kit
